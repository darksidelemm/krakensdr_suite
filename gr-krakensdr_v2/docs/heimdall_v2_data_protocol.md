# DoA Client ↔ Heimdall v2 Consumption Reference

All paths relative to `/home/krakenrf/krakensdr_v2/kraken_doa_v2/`.

---

## 1. Data connection (port 8091)

### 1.1 Connection sequence
- Constant: `TCP_DATA_PORT = 8091` (`include/config.hpp:9`), host default `127.0.0.1` (`include/networking/tcp_client.hpp:14`).
- `DataReceiver::data_receiver_thread()` (`src/networking/data_receiver.cpp:79`) loops: `data_client.connect_to_port(TCP_DATA_PORT)` → on failure sleep **1 s** and retry (`data_receiver.cpp:105-109`).
- **The client sends NOTHING on the data socket — ever.** Plain `connect()` then read-only. No handshake bytes, no subscription message. Heimdall streams to every connected data client unconditionally.
- On successful connect (`data_receiver.cpp:112-122`):
  - First successful connect only: `ControlHandler::apply_persisted_settings()` replays saved settings (which forwards tuner commands over the control port). Guarded by `settings_restored` so reconnects do NOT replay (`data_receiver.cpp:96-99, 114-117`).
  - `bytes_in_buffer = 0` — any partial packet from a previous connection is discarded so old/new bytes never splice (`data_receiver.cpp:119-122`).

### 1.2 Socket options (TCPClient, `src/networking/tcp_client.cpp`)
- `SO_RCVTIMEO = 500 ms` set on every connection (`tcp_client.cpp:32-37`) — blocking `recv()` is bounded so the `running` flag is polled; timeout (`EAGAIN`/`EWOULDBLOCK`/`EINTR`) is treated as "no data yet", not disconnect (`data_receiver.cpp:130-134`).
- **No** `TCP_NODELAY`, **no** `SO_KEEPALIVE`, **no** send/receive buffer tuning, **no** application-level keepalive anywhere in the client (verified by grep; the only `SO_RCVBUF` in the tree is in `gpsd_client.cpp:176`, unrelated).
- `send_data()` uses `MSG_NOSIGNAL`, loops on short writes/`EINTR`, and on `EAGAIN` polls `POLLOUT` with **200 ms** timeout before retrying; any other failure → `disconnect()` (`tcp_client.cpp:51-82`).
- The **data** socket stays blocking (with the 500 ms rcv timeout). Only the **control** socket is set non-blocking (`data_receiver.cpp:1070`).

### 1.3 Receive buffer & packet parsing state machine
- Userspace accumulation buffer: `vector<uint8_t> buffer(4 * 1024 * 1024)` — **4 MiB** (`data_receiver.cpp:86`).
- `recv()` appends at `buffer.data() + bytes_in_buffer`; `bytes_read <= 0` (and not EAGAIN/EINTR) → `"TCP connection lost, reconnecting..."` to stderr, `disconnect()`, break to outer reconnect loop (`data_receiver.cpp:136-140`). Reconnect is immediate (the 1 s backoff only applies to failed `connect()`s).
- Parse loop (`data_receiver.cpp:146-417`): `while (offset + 32 <= bytes_in_buffer)`:
  1. Read `magic = read_be32(buffer, offset)`; if `magic != TCP_MAGIC` → `offset++` and rescan (**byte-by-byte resync on magic**, `data_receiver.cpp:148-153`).
  2. Decode the 7 remaining header words (see §1.4).
  3. **Sanity gate before acting** (`data_receiver.cpp:163-173`): reject `channels == 0 || channels > MAX_CHANNELS(5)` or `samples == 0 || samples > 65536` (`MAX_SAMPLES_PER_CHANNEL`, `data_receiver.cpp:90`) → treated as a **false magic match**: `offset++`, resync. This prevents huge allocations / parser stalls on a desynced stream.
  4. `header_size = 32 + channels*8`; `packet_size = header_size + channels*samples*2`. If `offset + packet_size > bytes_in_buffer` → `break` (wait for more bytes) (`data_receiver.cpp:254-259`).
  5. Build `RawDataPacket` (`include/utils/raw_data_buffer.hpp:14-61`), convert selected channels (§2), push into `raw_data_buffer`.
  6. `offset += packet_size`.
- After the loop: `memmove` the残 remainder to the front, `bytes_in_buffer -= offset` (`data_receiver.cpp:419-424`).
- Downstream queue: global `RawDataBuffer raw_data_buffer(150, 2048, milliseconds(10000))` — max **150 packets / 2048 MB / 10 s** age (`data_receiver.cpp:38`); consumer drops packets stale by > **1500 ms** (`data_receiver.cpp:451`).

### 1.4 Header wire format & endianness (CRITICAL — mixed!)
Fixed 32-byte header, then per-channel metadata, then payload:

| Offset | Field | Decode | Endianness |
|---|---|---|---|
| +0 | magic | `read_be32` | **Big-endian** `TCP_MAGIC = 0x4D434851` = ASCII `"MCHQ"` in wire order (`config.hpp:11`) |
| +4 | num_channels | `read_be32` | Big-endian |
| +8 | samples_per_channel | `read_be32` | Big-endian |
| +12 | phase_comp_state | `read_be32` | Big-endian |
| +16 | noise_source (0/1) | `read_be32` | Big-endian |
| +20 | frequency_change_counter | `read_be32` | Big-endian |
| +24 | current_group_index | `read_be32` | Big-endian |
| +28 | retuning_in_progress | `read_be32` | Big-endian |
| +32 + ch·8 | channel ch frequency_hz | `read_le_float` | **Little-endian float32** |
| +36 + ch·8 | channel ch gain_db | `read_le_float` | **Little-endian float32** |
| +32 + channels·8 | IQ payload | raw bytes | channels × samples × 2 uint8, **channel-major**: channel `ch` at `header_size + ch*samples*2`, interleaved I,Q (`data_receiver.cpp:386`) |

(`data_receiver.cpp:148-161, 252-287`; decode helpers in `include/utils/endian_utils.hpp`: `read_be32` = `memcpy` + unconditional `__builtin_bswap32` — i.e. assumes little-endian host; `read_le_float` = raw `memcpy`, host/LE float.)

Per-channel metadata is pushed into `ChannelManager::update_channel_info(ch, freq, gain)` for every packet (`data_receiver.cpp:286`), which also stores `tuner_frequencies[ch]` (uint64, `src/channel_manager.cpp:68-80`).

### 1.5 num_channels / num_samples changes mid-stream
- Both are re-read from **every packet header**; all vectors (`channel_iq_data`, metadata) are resized per packet. No stream-level renegotiation exists.
- Global `num_channels` atomic updated every packet (`data_receiver.cpp:406`).
- `active_num_elements` (used by MUSIC/beamformer/UI) is synced from the packet when `channels != current && channels >= 2 && channels <= DOA_NUM_ELEMENTS(5)` (`data_receiver.cpp:409-414`).
- Out-of-range values are indistinguishable from desync and cause byte-wise resync (§1.3 step 3).

### 1.6 Reconnect/backoff summary
- connect failure → 1 s sleep, retry forever while `running`.
- recv error/EOF → immediate disconnect + reconnect attempt (then 1 s backoff on further failures).
- No exponential backoff; parse buffer cleared on each fresh connection; `first_packet` counter latch re-initializes `last_frequency_change_counter` on the first packet only of the *process* lifetime (static-free local, `data_receiver.cpp:93-94, 244-248`).

## 2. uint8 IQ → complex<float> conversion

`IQConverter::convert_uint8_to_complex_float()` (`src/utils/iq_converter.cpp:9-54`), called at `data_receiver.cpp:389-394` with `dc_correction = true` **always** in the packet path:

- Constants: `off = 127.5f`, `scl = 1.0f / 127.5f` (`iq_converter.cpp:19-20`).
- **DC-corrected path (the one actually used)**: two passes —
  1. compute `mean_i`, `mean_q` over the block (sums of raw uint8 values / num_samples);
  2. `output[i] = { (float(input[2i]) - mean_i) * scl, (float(input[2i+1]) - mean_q) * scl }`.
  So the offset subtracted is the **measured per-block DC mean, not 127.5** — 127.5 only defines the scale. Removes the FFT center spike.
- Non-DC path (not used by the receiver): `(float(x) - 127.5f) * (1/127.5f)` → range ≈ [-1.0, +1.0]. **Uses 127.5, not 128.**
- Plain scalar loops, compiler auto-vectorized (`-O3 -march=native`); intentionally NOT NEON intrinsics.
- Only channels that are actually needed are converted (stack flag array `channels_to_convert[MAX_CHANNELS]`): all channels in wideband-scan mode; channels 0..DOA_NUM_ELEMENTS-1 if DoA/beamforming/FM-with-5ch; plus the active FFT/FM channel. OpenMP `parallel for` if > 2 channels (`data_receiver.cpp:323-397`).

---

## 3. Control connection (port 8092)

### 3.1 Transport
- `TCP_CONTROL_PORT = 8092` (`config.hpp:10`). Single shared `TCPClient control_client` (`src/main.cpp:75`).
- `DataReceiver::send_control_command()` (`data_receiver.cpp:1048-1076`):
  - Serialized by a static `control_send_mutex` (uWS thread + scanner thread both send).
  - **Newline-framed**: `cmd + "\n"` — heimdall splits commands on newlines; without it back-to-back commands coalesce (`data_receiver.cpp:1056-1060`).
  - **Lazy connect**: connection opened on first command; socket set `O_NONBLOCK` after connect (`data_receiver.cpp:1067-1070`).
  - **Two attempts** then drop with stderr `"Control command dropped (server unreachable): ..."`.
- **The client NEVER reads from the control socket.** There is no `receive_data` call on `control_client` anywhere (grep-verified). Heimdall's control-port status JSON broadcasts are **ignored**; all status (phase_state, noise_source, frequencies, gains, retuning) is consumed from the **data-packet header** instead.

### 3.2 Exact JSON commands sent to heimdall
All single-line JSON + `\n`:

| Trigger (browser WS cmd) | JSON sent to 8092 | Ref |
|---|---|---|
| `FREQ:<MHz>` | `{"set_frequency":{"frequency":<hz_uint64>,"channel":<active_ch>}}` | `control_handler.cpp:295-297` |
| `WIDEBAND_FREQ:<MHz>` / scanner hops / continuous scanner retunes | `{"set_frequency":{"frequency":<hz>}}` (no channel key) | `control_handler.cpp:429-431`, `scanner_manager.cpp:677`, `continuous_scanner.cpp:726` |
| `GAIN:<dB>` | `{"set_gain":{"gain":<float_db>,"channel":<active_ch>}}` | `control_handler.cpp:454-456` |
| `FREQ_OFFSET:<kHz>` | `{"set_freq_offset":{"offset_hz":<hz_float>}}` | `control_handler.cpp:439-441` |
| `MIXER_SIDE:high\|low\|below` (wb variant; also re-asserted after every FREQ) | `{"set_mixer_side":{"side":"high"\|"low"\|"below"}}` | `control_handler.cpp:339-341, 385-387` |
| `LO_CURRENT:0..7` | `{"set_lo_current":{"current":<0-7>}}` | `control_handler.cpp:414-416` |
| `WIDEBAND_MODE:0/1` | `{"set_wideband_mode":{"enable":true\|false}}` | `control_handler.cpp:1179-1181, 280` |
| `WIDEBAND_BASE_FREQ:<MHz>` | `{"set_wideband_frequencies":{"base_frequency":<hz_uint32>}}` | `control_handler.cpp:1193-1196` |
| `EDGE_CLIP:<0.1-1.0>` | `{"set_wideband_edge_clip":{"edge_clip":<f>}}` | `control_handler.cpp:1430-1432` |
| Discrete scanner config | `{"configure_scanner":true,"frequency_groups":[<hz>,...],"dwell_time_ms":<ms>}` | `scanner_manager.cpp:187-196, 316-326` |
| Scanner start/stop | `{"start_scanner":true}` / `{"stop_scanner":true}` | `scanner_manager.cpp:333-334, 367-369, 651-653` |
| Scanner lock → coherent | `{"set_wideband_mode":{"enable":false}}` then `{"set_frequency":...}` | `scanner_manager.cpp:663-678` |
| Scanner resume | `{"set_wideband_mode":{"enable":true,"base_frequency":<hz>}}` + re-config + start | `scanner_manager.cpp:820-863` |
| Continuous scanner start/stop | `{"set_stability_delay":{"delay_ms":500}}` on start (wideband scan), `{"set_stability_delay":{"delay_ms":3000}}` restored on stop | `continuous_scanner.cpp:59-61, 137-139` |

`CHANNEL:`, `AVG:`, `BANDWIDTH:`, all MUSIC/topology/squelch/beamforming commands are **client-local** — nothing is sent to heimdall for them.

### 3.3 Phase-state / noise-source gating of DoA (verified logic)
- Every consumed packet calls `scanner_manager.updatePhaseCalibrationStatus(phase_comp_state, noise_source_active)` (`data_receiver.cpp:458-459` → `scanner_manager.cpp:557-576`): stores both atomics; if `noise_source_active` it stamps `last_noise_active_ns_` (steady_clock ns) so pollers catch bursts between polls; when scanner state is LOCKED it merely *logs* on `phase_state == 4` ("Phase calibration converged").
- **The DoA gate is `doa_is_calibrating()` (`src/doa_logger.cpp:37-51`) and it gates ONLY on the noise source, never on phase_state**:
  ```cpp
  constexpr long NOISE_QUIET_MS = 750;   // hold after last noise-on packet
  return scanner_manager.isNoiseSourceActive() || recent_noise;  // recent = within 750 ms
  ```
  Rationale in-code: steady-state DoA reports **phase_state 4 (CONVERGED)** — heimdall enum `heimdall_v2/src/core/types.hpp:28-30`: `WAITING_FOR_LAG_COMPLETION=0, MEASURING_INITIAL_PHASE=1, APPLYING_COMPENSATION=2, VERIFYING_CONVERGENCE=3, CONVERGED=4` — so a `phase_state < N` freeze would wrongly freeze everything. (Matches the memory note.)
- Where the gate is applied:
  - MUSIC pipeline hard gate: MUSIC is skipped entirely while `doa_is_calibrating() || doa_retune_hold_active()` (`data_receiver.cpp:593-600`) → published DoA freezes and covariance/auto-squelch never see noise-source data.
  - Auto eigenvalue-squelch learning: `allow_learn = fft_quiet && !doa_is_calibrating()` (`data_receiver.cpp:673`).
  - `DOA_value.html` HTTP endpoint: serves `last_good_message` verbatim while calibrating (`src/networking/websocket_server.cpp:493-505`).
  - DoA logger: `if (doa_is_calibrating()) continue;` (`doa_logger.cpp:622`).
- Cosmetic bug worth knowing: the receiver's log-name table `{"WAITING_LAG","MEASURING","WAITING_STABILITY","APPLYING","VERIFYING","CONVERGED"}` (`data_receiver.cpp:178`) has **6 entries and is misaligned** with heimdall's 5-state enum (would print "VERIFYING" for CONVERGED=4). Logging only; no logic depends on it.
- `noise_source` also surfaces to browsers as `"noise_source":true/false` in the 500 ms system_status JSON (`src/message_builders.cpp:447`).

## 4. Use of freq_change_counter / retuning_in_progress / current_group_index

All three come from the packet header (§1.4). Central mechanism: `g_last_retune_complete_ms` atomic + `RETUNE_DOA_HOLD_MS = 4000` ms hold during which **all** MUSIC processing is skipped (`data_receiver.cpp:61-76`) — needed because heimdall's ~3 s post-retune cooldown streams settling data with the noise source OFF, invisible to `doa_is_calibrating()`.

- **`retuning_in_progress`** (`data_receiver.cpp:186-229, 311-321`):
  - While nonzero: packet is **not processed** (no conversion, no FFT, no DoA); only `tuner_frequencies[ch]` are updated so the UI shows the target frequency; `offset += packet_size; continue`.
  - Falling edge 1→0 ("retuning complete"): arms the 4 s DoA hold; in non-wideband mode also bumps `fft_reset_generation`, sets `fft_data_valid=false`, drains `fft_work_queue`, `FFTProcessor::reset_all_buffers()`, clears wideband FFT buffers to -100 dB. In wideband-scan mode FFT reset is skipped (signals stay visible during drag-to-tune).
  - Known caveat (documented in code): the pulse can fall entirely between packets (~10-50 ms tuner reprogram), hence the two backup triggers below.
- **`frequency_change_counter`** (`data_receiver.cpp:231-248`): any change (after the first packet) logs `"Server frequency change detected!"` and arms the 4 s DoA hold; counter latched. Bumped by scanner group changes on the server.
- **Reference-channel metadata frequency** (belt-and-braces, `data_receiver.cpp:289-309`): if channel 0's header float changes by > 1.0 Hz between packets, arm the 4 s hold. Described as the only "ground truth in every packet" for plain retunes.
- **`current_group_index`**: decoded, logged in the frequency-change message, and stored in `RawDataPacket.current_group_index` (`data_receiver.cpp:160, 240, 267`) — **no consumer reads it downstream** (grep-verified: only set/logged). Discrete-scanner group tracking is done client-side instead.
